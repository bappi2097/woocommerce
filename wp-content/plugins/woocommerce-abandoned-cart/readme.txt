This easy-to-use plugin allows WooCommerce store owners to recover sales that are lost to abandoned shopping carts by customers. 

== Description ==

With the average shopping cart abandonment rate as high as 70%, [Abandoned Cart Plugin](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/woocommerce-abandoned-cart-pro/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite) helps you recover those carts from your WooCommerce shop. 

It works in the background, sending email notifications to your guests customers & logged-in customers, reminding them about their abandoned orders.

70% abandonment rate means that out of 100 potential customers, more than 70 of them are leaving without transacting on the store. Email Remarketing has proven to recover on average between 20-25% of abandoned shopping carts.

> This plugin works as described: the **lite version doesn't cut down in functionality**. **You can have your orders recovered and save on sales**. Depending on what you are selling, this can be a few orders to **justify ordering the full package - i'm only a few away!**

>**Very recommended!**

The Abandoned Cart plugin allows you to recover orders that were just a step away from closing. It enables you to create automatic & well-timed email reminders to be sent to your customers who have added your products to their cart, but did not complete the order. As a result, with this plugin you will start recovering at least 30% or more of your lost sales. Why let this 30% revenue go unclaimed?

Abandoned Cart Lite plugin enables to do the following things:

1. Allow your customers to recover their abandoned carts in a **single click**.
2. Identify the **Abandoned Orders information**, including the products that were abandoned.
3. The plugin now captures abandoned **guest carts**. A guest user's cart will be captured on the **Checkout page**, if it is abandoned after entering the **email address**.
4. Track **abandoned orders value v/s recovered orders value**.
5. Admin is notified by email when an order is **recovered**.
6. Works off-the-shelf as it comes with 1 **default email template**.
7. Create **unlimited email templates** to be sent at intervals that you set - Intervals start from 1 hour after cart is abandoned.
8. Add custom variables like **Customer First Name, Customer Last name, Customer full name, Cart Link & Product Cart Information** in the email template.
9. Copy HTML from anywhere & create templates using the powerful **Rich Text Editor**.
10. **Automatically stops email notifications** when a customer makes a purchase or uses the cart recovery link.

**Email Sending Setup:**

Abandoned Cart Plugin relies on a function called WP-Cron, and this function only runs when there is a page requested. So, if there are no visits to your website, then the scheduled jobs are not run. Generally this method of sending the abandoned cart notification emails is reliable. However, if you are not very confident about the traffic volume of your website, then you can set a manual cron job via cPanel or any other control panel that your host provides.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Lite and Pro version of the plugin? =

To see how the PRO version can help you recover more abandoned carts compared to Lite, you can refer **[here](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/differences-between-pro-and-lite-versions-of-abandoned-cart-for-woocommerce-plugin/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=faqlink&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite "Lite and Pro version Difference")**

= How is the email address of the customers captured? =

Our plugin captures visitor emails in real-time as they're typing it in to the email address field on the checkout page, so you don't need to worry about them changing their mind at the last second.

When logged-in user add the product to the cart we capture the email address from the user's profile.

= Can the plugin track carts abandoned by guest users? =

Yes, it captures the carts of the guest users from the checkout page. We capture the guest user's abandoned cart only after the customer enters the "Email Address" on the checkout page.

Also, plugin does capture the cart from the cart page, these carts do not have any personal information of the customers. It will contain only the cart details. To capture, this information guest customer should reach the cart page of the website.

= Why are abandoned cart notification emails not getting sent? =

Please ensure you have at least one Email template "Active". As only active email templates are sent to recover the abandoned carts. 

For sending the abandoned cart notification emails automatically, we use WP-Cron. If you have Email templates activated and still notification are not sent, then you can debug the issue by following this **[post](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/using-wp_alternate_cron-to-overcome-the-problem-of-emails-not-being-sent-in-abandoned-cart-pro-plugin-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=AbandonedCartLite "WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro")**.

= When is the cart considered as an abandoned cart? =

When the products in the cart is not purchased within the set 'Cart abandoned cut-off time' then the cart is considered as an abandoned cart.

= How to unsubscribe the abandoned cart notification emails? =

The admin can use the merge code `{{cart.unsubscribe}}' in the email templates. It will be replaced with a url in the abandoned cart email notification sent to the customer. When clicked, the reminder email notification for the particular email will be unsubscribed.

We have used microtime function & a security key. Using this security key, and after applying an algorithm on it, we generate the encoded string.

* The session now starts only on required pages of the store. Earlier it was started globally. This will help to improve the site performance.

* If billing email address of the logged-in user is not set then it was showing blank space on the abandoned orders list. This has been fixed. Now it will show the email address which was used while registering to the store.
